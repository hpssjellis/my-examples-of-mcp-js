These examples are going to use client-side browser MCP server with MCP client but it will be much more useful to make a NodeJS websocket
server for the mcp server and client to chat with. That way you are not stuck with single web instance. The clients coud be on several different computers



Note 2025 webMCP is a different style and it is at
